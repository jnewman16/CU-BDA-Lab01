# STSCI 4780 Lab 1 Assignment

Hello, my name in John Newman, and I am a Junior currently enrolled in Applied and Engineering Physics.

I hope to apply what I learn in Bayesian Data Analysis to the several fields in my major which frequently require a statistical evaluation of certain phenomenon. For instance, this semester, I am taking a class in Quantum Mechanics in which I hope that a Bayesian approach will allow me to develop an intuition for a field which necessarily contains many instances of doubt and probability.
