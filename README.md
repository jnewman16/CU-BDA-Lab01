# STSCI 4780 Lab 1 Assignment

Hello, my name is John Newman, and I am a Junior currently enrolled in the Applied and Engineering Physics program at Cornell.

I hope to apply what I learn in Bayesian Data Analysis to the several fields in my major which frequently require a statistical evaluation in certain situations. For instance, this semester, I am taking a class in Quantum Mechanics in which I hope that a Bayesian approach will allow me to develop an intuition for a field which necessarily contains many instances of doubt and probability.

In addition to Quantum Mechanics, I must also take a class next semester in Statistical Mechanics, which, as you can imagine, relies heavily on statistics. Although I do not have much experience in the field in general, I hope that this class will increase my exposure to certain types of probabilities and statistics. After the first two lectures, it seems as though these hopes were well-placed.

Finally, the most compelling reason for me to take this class is to placate my mother, who disapproves of my choice to pursue physics and philosophy. My very survival may depend on my participation in a class which she has deemed acceptable. Perhaps in four months, I will be free from the ruthless clutches of my five foot tall Italian mother. One can only hope.

Currently, I look to acquire a position in the Brock Research Lab, studying Pulsed Laser Deposition. According to an introduction to Pulsed Laser Deposition from Andor.com, PLD enables the creation of high quality thin films, which can be used in the production of superconducting, circuit, and medical components. Yet despite the incredible applications of PLD films, the exact processes which occur during the transfer of ablated material to its substrate are still not fully understood.

With uncertainty about the fundamental phenomena that occur during PLD, much research is currently focused on empirically optimizing the ablation and condensation of certain target and substrate combinations. As such, I hope that a Bayesian analysis which looks at the frequency of undesirable outcomes, such as interfering macroscopic globules and non-uniform films, could not only yield insights into ways to improve the process, but also gain a greater understanding of the underlying causes.
