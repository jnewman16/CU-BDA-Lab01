# STSCI 4780 Lab 1 Assignment

Hello, my name is John Newman, and I am a Junior currently enrolled in the Applied and Engineering Physics program at Cornell.

I hope to apply what I learn in Bayesian Data Analysis to the several fields in my major which frequently require a statistical evaluation in certain situations. For instance, this semester, I am taking a class in Quantum Mechanics in which I hope that a Bayesian approach will allow me to develop an intuition for a field which necessarily contains many instances of doubt and probability.

In addition to Quantum Mechanics, I must also take a class next semester in Statistical Mechanics, which, as you can imagine, relies heavily on statistics. Although I do not have much experience in the field in general, I hope that this class will increase my exposure to certain types of probabilities and statistics. After the first two lectures, it seems as though these hopes were well-placed.
